Powerful & stylish contact form. Excellent deliverability with Amazon SES & security with Google reCAPTCHA V3.

== Description ==

With Squawk Forms, you can create beautiful and responsive contact forms in minutes, while relying on Amazon SES for email deliverability and Google reCAPTCHA V3 for enhanced security against spam and bots.

Amazon SES is known for its high deliverability rates and advanced email analytics. Configuring your WordPress site to send emails via Amazon SES ensures that your emails reach their intended recipients' inboxes and avoid getting marked as spam or blocked by email filters.

In addition to email deliverability, Squawk Forms also adds an extra layer of security to your site by integrating Google reCAPTCHA V3. This helps to protect your site from spam and automated bot attacks.

Squawk Forms offers a highly customizable design that can be tailored to match the style and branding of your website.
